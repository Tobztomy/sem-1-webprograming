<h4>A common problem with creating a link using an HTML editor <br>is that your links will work just fine when your web file is on your computer,<br> but when you place the files on the web server, the links all break. This is because your editor is pointing the link to a location on your computer and not the correct location as it should be on the server as illustrated above.<br>

There are a number of locations on the Engineering network that have been set aside for serving web pages via the Internet.<br> These locations are basically directories on the network that have been configured as a location to “serve” web pages via the Internet. The main thing to remember concerning this is that any directory or file that is “up” from the web directory is invisible to the Internet.<br> Or in other words, the only files visible on the Internet are within a web directory that has been created to serve web pages, and any sub-directories it contains. And so any link to a location that is not within that directory will not work. The browser will tell you that the link could not be found.

For example: all faculty, staff and students in the Engineering College have access to a “public_html” directory that has been set aside to serve web pages from within your U:\ drive. So all files placed within the public_html directory can be viewed via the Internet. But any file within your U:\ drive that is not within your public_html directory can not be seen or linked to via the web.<br>
Besides linking to another web page or within another location on a page,<br> you can also create a link to an email address. Depending on the browser’s ability,<br> the operating system and the software installed, this will cause the viewer’s email program to automatically load and the email address will be placed in the “send to” field of the new email window.
